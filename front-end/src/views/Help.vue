      Under the explosive development of the Internet age, everything is
      possible in the online world from buying, selling, trading to conferences.
      When you receive an email, word or excel file, it's really just a
      duplicate. But when it comes to assets like money, contracts, intellectual
      property, stocks, bonds, personal information or creative products, things
      are completely different. That is why today we completely rely on
      intermediaries like banks, governments, social media companies or credit
      card companies etc. to build self-confidence and as others. All these
      intermediaries perform the same functional logic of transactions in
      commerce, from authentication and validation of personal information to
      the creation and deletion of records. However, more and more new problems
      arise: information leaks, these intermediate channels make everything
      time-consuming and slower, etc. Therefore, our team built FOVEMOSO using
      blockchain technology based on Solidity code to solve the above problems.
      FOVEMOSO requires no human intervention, thus ensuring the fastest, safest
      and most accurate execution.
